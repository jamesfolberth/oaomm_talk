Abstract:
Certain optimization problems have special, geometric constraints, which specify that the solution of the optimization problem must lie on a manifold.  The recent text "Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds", by P.-A. Absil, R. Mahoney, and R. Sepulchre (2008), develops the necessary machinery from differential geometry and discusses various problems on matrix manifolds, with an emphasis on computing invariant subspaces of matrices.  The authors develop gradient descent, Newton's method, trust-region methods, and other high-order methods.  This talk will highlight some of the tools required to pose gradient descent on matrix manifolds, demonstrate a few examples in Manopt, a MATLAB toolbox for optimization on manifolds, and discuss a few recent results.  None of this talk is my own work, but I hope to convey some of the excitement in this field which is quickly gaining momentum.
